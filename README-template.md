## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- tailwind CSS
- Django
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwindcss
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Django framework


### What I learned

I learnt how to use Django framework to build a multi-step form. I also learnt how to use tailwindcss to style the form.

```html 
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
```python
def proud_of_this_python_func():
  print('ðŸŽ‰')
```
```tailwindcss
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
```django
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load static %}
{% block content %}
{% endblock content %}
```


### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about Django framework and tailwindcss. I will also learn how to use Django to build a full stack web application.



### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for styling the form. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - This is an amazing framework. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
